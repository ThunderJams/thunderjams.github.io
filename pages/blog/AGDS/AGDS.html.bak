So Jams! So updating my website for the first time in almost a year!</span></p><p class="c19 subtitle" id="h.68rz9yl652y"><span class="c20">06/04/2024</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c15"><span class="c1">Long time no see! If you&rsquo;ve explored my website you&rsquo;ll probably find out first-hand that my focus comes in cycles - consistency is not my strong suit, and consistency is maybe the most important part of having a blog. My last blog posts were made during my last hyperfixation on making my website - now I&rsquo;m remaking my website and the hyperfixation is back. So enjoy this moment together, when the hyperfixation well runs dry I&rsquo;ll be gone for another year!</span></p><p class="c0 c15"><span class="c1">In March of 2024 - Wix decided to dramatically increase its prices - and I am unbelievably cheap and stingy; so I&rsquo;m taking matters into my own hands and writing my new site with HTML. There are probably many better, other ways to do this - but hey, that&rsquo;s for the next website overhaul hyperfixation phase.</span></p><p class="c0 c15"><span class="c1">As to not just be a &ldquo;hey, I exist&rdquo; kind of update; here&rsquo;s a list of things that happened since I last updated my blog in&hellip; March 2023?</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_ubuqllmfh2lg-0 start"><li class="c0 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Did the honours thing</span></li><li class="c0 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Graduated from the uni thing</span></li><li class="c0 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Worked at the uni thing for two months</span></li><li class="c0 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Started to do the freelance thing</span></li><li class="c0 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Joined Biome Collective (and did some things)</span></li><li class="c0 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Resumed development on that For Hexposure thing</span></li><li class="c0 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Made 4 game jam things</span></li><li class="c0 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Hosted a talk thing at the Abertay Game Dev Society</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That last thing is what I want to especially talk about here - everything else is fairly well documented across the site - but being invited to do a talk was a pretty big event for me! I had never really done something on that scope before - but it went down really well and I&rsquo;m glad that I got to portray some of my own personal perspective to the students.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I tailored the talk to advice I wished I had as a student - I don&#39;t think I&rsquo;d be exactly qualified to give out grand, sweeping industry advice or really technical advice, so I felt like trying to provide a slice of my own vulnerability and honesty and story for the audience would be the best call. One of the things I particularly suffered from as a student was imposter syndrome - heck, I still see myself falling for it nowadays on occasion. A lot of my own personal identity has come about from trying to battle imposter syndrome - continuing to create and be vulnerably honest to override the fear that I&rsquo;m never as good as anyone else. The world is not on a linear track - I am never going to be the best by all objective metrics, but I do have my own artistic identity and style that keeps me going and growing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>There have been so many moments where I have personally looked up to an artist or peer in some way - and inherently I have been comparing myself to them, viewing their skill level as an insurmountable ceiling from which I am crumpled onto the living room floor. But in quite a lot of those instances, I&rsquo;ve found that when I actually talked to those artists, they ended up appreciating and looking up to </span><span class="c6">me</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in different ways? The slides for the talk that I&rsquo;ll link will somewhat cover this, but there are a few anecdotes I ended up dropping on the spot that I&rsquo;m going to relay here. See this as a sort of commentary track to the slides!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The slides feature some references to a mysterious &lsquo;Jack&rsquo; - someone who I met in my 1st year classes of uni who seemingly had infinite amounts of charisma and knowledge about everything about computers and programming and everything ever somehow. And I just consistently compared myself - even after we became friends, even after I started succeeding in other areas. It is very hard to comprehend the different stages in growth and different areas of specialisation when you are in the weeds of creation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>One night I was talking home with this &lsquo;Jack&rsquo; fellow and, in an interaction he probably doesn&rsquo;t remember, he said that I was one of the best programmers he had ever met - which I immediately responded with&hellip; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s bullshit.&rdquo; Because, in my head, I felt like I was no comparison to his level of technical knowledge and skill, and he had to know other people far more technically competent than me. But he elaborated - and said that no one else thought about games in the same way as me - that my brain interfaced with game mechanics with such an efficiency that </span><span class="c6">he </span><span>looked up to. And after thinking </span><span>on it</span><span class="c1">, I realised that he was right. During DARE, we had a Gantt chart of implementation time, and things were supposed to take around 4 weeks. When we got to actually implementing that list of things&hellip; I did most of it over two days. It&rsquo;s so easy to feel unremarkable when the only context you have is your own self - but I have had to force myself to feel remarkable ever since. Every little thing I do, I try to take a little pride in. Updating this website made me realise that I have done a huge amount of things, in a variety of directions, even just in the past few years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Especially since a lot of those things are in different directions, it&rsquo;s hard to calculate the overwhelming magnitude of progress I have made since those days where I felt particularly small. But hearing how other people talk about me has shown me that the progress has been occurring in spades - and one day I&rsquo;ll look back on the overwhelming kingdom I&rsquo;ve crafted, and the progress will be undeniable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I am the only person that is making games that are Undeniably Me - and living in that feeling, and the comfy little niche it gives me, is sometimes all I have and all I can attract value from. Life, society, and all of its byproducts can be so competitive - and I am unable to compete in that way. I wasn&rsquo;t built for competition, and that much becomes evermore clear as I keep going - but I was built for expression, so I&rsquo;m gonna keep trying at that part.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>If you want to read the slides of my talk, they can be found here: </span><span class="c17"><a class="c12" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1F7j__aTkb1tcOXuturtrg08P4no4tK-wZw8s5_1c3ww/edit?usp%3Dsharing&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1712540246988713&amp;usg=AOvVaw1DWRsFpLan3a5rzPaCt2IR">public AGDS TALK MAR14</a></span></p><div><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p></div></div></body></html>
