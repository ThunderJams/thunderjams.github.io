    <p>Sometimes I want to talk about a game, but don't want to write a whole article for it. So here's a sneak peek into my brain - games I played in 2025. This is mostly games finished with some other juicy inclusions I felt important to talk about! Time for the shocking reveal that I... mostly just play Nintendo games. That's my comfort food!</p>

    <h2>Sonic X Shadow Generations</h2>
    <img alt="" class="perma-img" src="images/SXS.png" style=" title="">
    <h3>Following in Frontiers' Shadow</h3>
    <p>Sonic is doing a very weird thing right now. Or, I mean... going open world isn't weird generally, in fact, it's very boring from a global gaming standpoint. Every AAA game under the sun is making a big open world adaptation and falsely misunderstanding the appeal of Breath of the Wild (a theme we'll see return later in this list!), and Sonic Frontiers is exactly that to me - a game that ditches the immaculate vibe of Sonic to be a bland, sparse island aesthetic with jingly piano and blue cybernetic flourishes.</p>
    <p>...Or that's what I would say, if it were actually true - but Sonic Frontiers is not open world, it's more like a game that emphasizes big hub worlds that link to smaller, more focused Sonic levels. In that sense, it's not even different from a game like Sonic Adventure 1, where hubs like Station Square link together Emerald Coast and Twinkle Park. And the idea of having a big hub for Sonic to parkour around in is awesome! It actually makes those big hubs feel fun and worthwhile, rather than just empty space.</p>
    <p>But Sonic Frontiers, and now Shadow Generations (which is vertiably a sequel to Sonic Frontiers, even if it's wearing the skin of Sonic Generations like a chimera) make a fatal flaw in disregarding the one, single thing that Sonic has staked it's legacy upon - that killer vibe. The world design, the bright and vivid colours, they are all so classically Sonic. But Shadow Generations doesn't have a big open world with an awesome aesthetic to do platforming challenges in... it has a bland, white void to do platforming challenges in. It's like cognitive dissonance in gameplay form.</p>
    <p>The gameplay of this game rocks, and the actual levels do too, from music to visual effects - it's firing on all cylinders... except that hub world! Give it some colour and aesthetic and you've got something amazing. Imagine if instead of a bland, white void - the hub was a vibrant amusement park, like in Sonic Colours! Or a rocking cityscape to city escape from! Or even just the classic green and brown checkerboard hills... but give me something other than knockoff Zelda aesthetics and empty void. I believe in you Sonic Team!</p>
    <p>(I do think Shadow Generations is a nice step up from Frontiers. So I guess that's some improvement!)</p>

    <h2>Beat Sketcher</h2>
    <img alt="" class="perma-img" src="images/image1.jpg" style=" title="">
    <h3>I like to make music that... Moves people</h3>
    <p>Somehow I've never talked about this on my website, but I own basically every Xbox 360 Kinect game ever released. I love a janky weird peripheral, and I kinda just... decided to get every game for them. And that slope turned slippery, and I started to collect every Playstation Move exclusive, and uh... I guess I'm here writing an article about Beat Sketcher, an oft forgotten drawing DAW for the PS3.</p>
    <p>I find the idea of drawing using the Move, and each line you draw adding an audio track synced correctly to the key and rhythm, just so fascinating. It's a bit Osu! It's a bit Mario Paint! It's just a bit quirky and weird. Not too much to say about this one, other than finding it a great expression of what weird control methods can do for making more abstract gaming experiences.

    <h2>Guitar Hero 2</h2>
    <img alt="" class="perma-img" src="images/GH.png" style=" title="">
    <h3>Plastic Nonsense Slop</h3>
    <p>From one rhythm game accentuated by plastic crap to the next; Guitar Hero is a series I've always been aware of but never had the correct goop for it. But due to a fortunate circumstance, I ended up with 4 Guitar Hero guitars in my possession, and a relentless drive to see what this series has to offer. So whilst my good friend Henry (<a href="https://www.sugarcyube.com/">his website</a>) was visiting, I brought out these guitars and put them to good use.</p>
    <p>As in - I had to take a call in the other room, whilst he andSS my friend Cyps (<a href="https://cyps.itch.io/">her website</a>) beat the entire career mode with our band "Cursed Orphan". But I did give GH a fair shake, and I had a good time. I moreso enjoyed the utility of using my USB guitar to play Clone Hero and slam down any song I was fixating on that day! Good times.</p>

    <h2>Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door (Switch)</h2>
    <img alt="" class="perma-img" src="images/TTYD.jpg" style=" title="">
    <h3>Booked and Blessed</h3>
    <p>Throughout my entire life, The Thousand Year Door was very much "the one that got away" in terms of Nintendo games. I love Paper Mario 64 and Super Paper Mario as if they were my own children, but TTYD's huge price consistently stopped me from playing it. That is, until Nintendo finally remade the game for the Switch last year - which I played and adored, but just never finished until this year.
<br>
There are so many amazing things I can say about TTYD, but there are two things that specifically resonate with me. The battle system and it's meaningful choices, and the dialogue. The latter is fairly self-explanitory, if you've played any of my games you can see how much of an impact the writing style of this game has had on me. Something about the snark hits that perfect line of "whimsical and simple enough for kids, but cereberal and funny enough for adults" that I adore so much and has always resonated with me.
<br>
But that battle system? It's so good. A lot of JRPGs suffer from providing systems with just way too many micro-level choices that in turn null and void each other (have more to say about this later!), but Paper Mario's badge and battle commands system is so elegant. It lets people get into customising their loadout in such a stripped back way, intuitively making each level up count and make you feel more powerful without actually ever giving you Big Number Inflation. I'm sure some people like a huge number go up system, but for me that incredibly noticeable feeling of each point you progress in Paper Mario is unmatched. In fact, that's all that needs to be said: Paper Mario is unmatched.
<br>
Bonus shout out to the amazing new remixes and diagetic music in the remake, brings the whole thing together.</p>
