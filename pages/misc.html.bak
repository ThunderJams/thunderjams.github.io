<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<h4>I am, at heart, a generalist. I want to do everything - I feel empowered by the creative process when I see all sides of it - designing what I implement, sketching worlds and molding them with my bare hands. I am not a master of all, by any means - but I want to highlight every little thing that I do here in order to actualise it. Progress is slow, and I am easily distracted - but if I want to continue to put whatever I make into the world. Embracing the awkward one-offs, embracing that growth.</h4>
<h4>This is all entirely self-indulgent, so that's why it's tucked here at the bottom. But on the off chance someone else is reading all of this, let me know! My emails are always open.</h4>
<h4>"I feel, at any given time, tuggеd in all directions at once. That is, if anything can be thus dеscribed, my defining quality." - the Narcissist Cookbook, STOPPING A GARDEN HOSE WITH YOUR THUMB</h4>

<h3 id="Music">Music</h3>
<h4>I've been playing music since I was a kid - forced by school, took piano lessons, self-taught guitar, the classic story. One thing that held me back from composing is that I couldn't make what I wanted to - so I devalued what I could make. </h4>
<h4>But based on some advice from musician extrordinaire Calum Sarjeant (linked below) - I've just been setting out with the desire to create something, anything - and seeing where I can go from there. That's what I'm chronicling here!</h4>

<h4>When I started at uni, I made a promise that I would try and draw something, every month, to see the improvement process. I kept this up for all of 2020, and whilst I did less in following years, I still try and keep it up.</h4>

<h4>As of recent, I've been trying to 3D model using Nomad Sculpt - I've been finding it incredibly relaxing to listen to a podcast and sculpt something early in the morning. So far I've mostly been creating 3D models of For Hexposure characters - but I'm hoping to do some more when I have the time.</h4>
