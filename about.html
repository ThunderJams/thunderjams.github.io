	<h2>About</h2>
	<h4>Hi, I'm Ewan! I'm a freelance games programmer and designer, and co-founder of Yellow Crow Games. I have an exhaustive passion for all parts of the creative process - writing, designing, coding, and everything in between. I love crafting needlessly detailed, emotionally resonant and whimsical worlds that take advantage of the medium of games.</h4>
