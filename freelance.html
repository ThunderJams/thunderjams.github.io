        <div class="filterDiv programming 2023"><h3>Programmer - Abertay University - 2023</h3>
<h4>This was a contract over the Summer of 2023, to take over and continue development of a unique game exhibit on show to the public at the Dundee Waterfront.</h4>
<h4>This involved working independently to short deadlines as the primary programmer on small team. The main focus was on optimisation of an existing code base and implementation of new features, testing and working directly with lead designer on the project, and implementing with regards to specific hardware - the installation is built with a bespoke control and screen set up.</h4>
<h4>The project was originally developed by Abertay Game Lab and Konglomerate Games (whilst I didn't work with them directly, I've linked their page below). It was a super interesting experience to work on a project from more of a maintenance perspective - that HUGELY increased the quality of my own code following this project. It was a lovely environment to work in, Lynn and Gaz made it so welcoming. Having something I've worked on permanently available in the city (when maintained) feels really... conclusive? Like I've left a nice mark in my 5 years there, even if it's just a little thing. </h4>
<h4>As of June 2024 the setup is up and running with the iteration made by me! If there are any major updates I'll (try) to keep this page updated.</h4>

<h3>Workshop Facilitator - Tinderbox Collective - 2024-26</h3>
<h4>At the Tinderbox Games Clubs - I help facilitate the session, working with kids over the course of several weeks to create a game as a group. Teaching them game design, working in a variety of software, implementing in Construct 3 and Bitsy.</h4>
<h4>This has been an absolute joy and has really rekindled my love of youth work! I used to be a Youth Facilitator with Beacon Youth Theatre in Greenock, trying to help kids with drama and improv - and so this feels like the next step in that legacy. Seeing how young people engage with the world of creativity and art, and expanding their horizons is incredible.</h4>
<h4>The young people's work has been exhibited at countless local events, including Push The Boat Out, Scotland's national poetry festival in 2025.</h4>

<h3>Arts Installation Exhibitor - Hidden Door Festival, Tinderbox Collective - 2025</h3>
<h4>For the 2025 Hidden Door Festival, I participated in the Room To Play project, working with 8 other fabulous young artists of a variety of different disciplines to create an interactive installation. This was a fascinating experience - so cool to work with artists with skills so outside of my own, and to feel equal to them.</h4>
<h4>The installation had an overarching theme of reclaiming nature - using sculptures of salvaged materials, contrasted with bits of nature to tell a story of how we as young creatives in 2025 feel about the emerging state of the world. Seeing how ideas of other artists could be infused with the interactive elements I brought to the project as a game designer was truly awesome!</h4>
<h4>My main focuses on the project involve working on the Wishing Wall - a projected visual which the user could interact with using the Kinect to answer questions, getting them to actively think about the state of the world, and to display visuals created by the other artists. After answering the questions - the audience was prompted to leave a place in the world that inspires them: man-made or natural. I ended up collating those answers and would love to make something more interactive with them (for now I've just generated a word cloud, which you can see below).</h4>
<h4>Additionally, I got to play a bit with Arduino's and wiring simple micro-controllers to interace with Touch Designer. In the Plant Refuge, the audience could touch these fake plants to activate beacons at their side and play a soothing string sample.</h4>
<h4>This project was an absolute joy and it has really inspired me to branch out of my typical views of what I define my artistry as. More info on all of the artists involved can be found on the Room To Play page - check them all out!</h4>
