	<h2>About</h2>
	<h4>Hi, I'm Ewan! I'm a game designer and programmer, and graduate from BSc (Honours) in Computer Games Applications Development at Abertay University. I have a passion for creating games where whimsicality meets emotion - writing, designing and coding experiences that I find exciting.</h4>
	<h4>I just recently finished my Honours Project - researching Procedural Content Generation in order to create algorithmically generated 3D Platformer levels.</h4>
	<h4>During Summer 2022, I worked on For Hexposure with Yellow Crow Games for Abertay's Dare Academy competition - going on to show the game at EGX and win both the whole competition, as well as the Dell Prize!</h4>
	<h4>In terms of programming - I'm well versed in both C# and C++, and I have experience working in both Unity and Unreal - mainly focused on gameplay programming. In terms of narrative, I'm fluent in Google Docs. More detailed info on my skills can be found here!</h4>
