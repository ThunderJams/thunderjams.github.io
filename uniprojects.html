                <h4>Below is a collection of assignments created during my study at Abertay University. These are more so available as a programming showcase - and as such are not visually polished or tested on all devices.</h4>

<h3>Disc Golf - Augmented Reality Assignment</h3>
<h4>Created using Unreal Engine 5 - this is a mobile game that uses AR for an arcade sports game where the player can toss a frisbee from their hand and have it fly into the goal using Unreal's physics systems.</h4>
<h4>This project has a lot of extra work put into it for polish - including UI, menu options and sound effects. It also provided a lot of experience working with Unreal and needing to adhere to Epic's coding standards, as well as experience in Blueprinting!</h4>

<h3>Wwise Audio Project</h3>
<h4>This project makes use of Unity and Wwise to create a dynamic soundscape. Focusing on implementing spatialised sounds, audio effects and dynamic music.</h4>



<h4>The project involves the player hiding from their parent - listening to the soundscape, determining where they are based on the direction of the footsteps, and trying to play their games console undetected. I loved working with Wwise to try and create this delicate and anxious environment, and it could be fun to expand this someday to create a more realised slice of software.

â€‹

The app can be played here, but it's kind of a big file - I'll work on getting a video of it at some point!!</h4>
